Diskbackup_python
=================

A script to store data to a mass storage disk using a simple python script. 
The data in the storage will still be readable. 
The data can be updated to the storage and can also be recovered.
Main idea of this script is to minimize backup time for files.

This code is made in python 3 so maybe it is not 100% compatible with python 2.
